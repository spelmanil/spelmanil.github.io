# Microsoft Faculty Mini Grant Call for Proposals
  


## Purpose
The Spelman Innovation Lab has the objective of promoting interdisciplinary ideation, creation, design and making, particularly when such activity has a significant technical component.
The Microsoft Mini Grant Program offers faculty support for developing new teaching and projects that supports the goals of the lab.  Grant proposals should fall into one of two tracks:

* Track A grants provide a fixed amount of $3000 for course development
* Track B grants provide up to $5000 to support Innovation Lab projects

Approximately one dozen grants will be awarded.

## Description
Track A grants provide support for developing a course that supports the Innovation Curriculum.  That is, courses that bridge STEM and non-STEM disciplines.  Courses in need of development include, but are not limited to:  

* Physical Computing
* Game Development I & II
* Augmented Reality
* Digital Animation
* Sound Engineering

Track B grants provide up to $5000 to support student-engaging, interdisciplinary projects with a significant technical component.  You are encouraged to contact the lab directors ([Jerry Volcy](jvolcy@spelman.edu), [Jaycee Holmes](jholme15@spelman.edu), [Eric Thompson](pthomp14@spelman.edu)) to review your idea and review suitable past projects. (maybe a link to a website might be good here.  Storm dress “Fluid Future”, LED unitard, Army drone, electric fish, video wall, Cardi B, Exercise Bike project)


## Eligibility
For Track A, all full-time faculty or faculty teams are eligible to apply.  Faculty teams will divide the stipend.
For Track B, all faculty and staff are eligible to apply.


## Application Cycle
Track A applications will be accepted on a rolling schedule until funds are exhausted.  You are encouraged to apply early.
Track B applications are offered twice per year with deadlines of April 1 and October 1.  The April deadline is extended to May 1 for the year 2021.


## Requirements
Both tracks require the submission of a grant proposal.  In both cases, the review process will begin upon receipt of the proposal and a best-effort award decision will be made within 30 days.  Awardees agree to complete a pre- and post- survey  (<15 minutes) conducted by the Innovation Lab.

___Track B Requirements___  
Does the project have a significant technology component?
Is the project interdisciplinary?
Does the project engage and enrich one or more students?
